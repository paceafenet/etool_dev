## Get Data

This is the same as the code I use to read into the application. 

```{r}
curr_date <- Sys.Date()

alerts <- read_csv(file = "Alert Data\\alert_data.csv") %>% 
  filter(activity_required_maint == "Yes" | 
           activity_required_calib == "Yes")

# Alert Data\\alert_data.csv


```

## Create the email to send to the maintenance engineer based on the current state of the data
